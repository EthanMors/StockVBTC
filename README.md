This project was an analysis of Bitcoin and how to it competes with more traditional investments in stocks.
I was set to discover is BTC more risky than traditional investments as the mainstream media tends to say that Crypto in general is more risky.
I used many forms of analysis looking are rolling patterns, measuiring beta, volitility, overall returns, sharpe ratios, and fluctuations in daily price over the last two years.
